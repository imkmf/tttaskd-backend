# tttaskd-backend

tttaskd-backend is a Rails application that serves as the backend for [tttaskd](https://github.com/imkmf/tttaskd), a React/Redux GTD application.

This app is pretty basic, but has some interesting bits for authenticating with JWT - you could probably re-use the code for things like a mobile or frontend application.
